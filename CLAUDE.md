- Reminder: Created memory file for tracking Claude's interactions and reflections on the Twilio Ultravox Agent Server project.
- Investigated date parsing challenges in the restaurant booking system
- Explored multiple NLP libraries for natural language date parsing
- Identified chrono-node as the most robust solution for converting natural language dates to YYYY-MM-DD format
- Noted key requirements for date parsing:
  * Handle relative dates like "tomorrow", "next Wednesday"
  * Support complex date expressions
  * Provide fallback mechanisms
  * Consistent date formatting
- Confirmed need for a specialized tool to convert human-spoken dates into machine-readable formats
- Created README.md file to document project overview and setup instructions
- Implemented comprehensive Zod validation system across the entire application
  * Replaced express-validator with type-safe Zod schemas
  * Added advanced validation for all input types
  * Created custom error handling and transformation
- Developed modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
  * Created versioned API routes (/v1/)
  * Implemented controllers, services, and middleware
  * Enhanced error handling and logging mechanisms
- Added Helmet.js for security middleware
- Implemented Winston logging with structured, context-aware logging
- Created sophisticated async error handling with detailed error types
  * Added ApplicationError, ValidationError, DatabaseError classes
  * Comprehensive error reporting and logging
- Developed API versioning strategy with flexible routing
- Enhanced testing framework with comprehensive test coverage
- Created Docker configuration for separate container deployment
- Implemented Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL for robust data persistence
- Completed comprehensive production-ready implementation including:
  * Graceful shutdown handlers with signal management
  * Enhanced health check system with detailed metrics
  * Complete API versioning with /v1/ structure
  * Production-ready Docker deployment configuration
  * Comprehensive test suite with 134+ tests covering all functionality
  * Advanced error handling with typed error classes
  * Security hardening with Helmet.js and input validation
  * Structured logging with Winston and correlation IDs
  * Rate limiting and request timeout handling
  * Complete modular refactoring for maintainability
- Established core testing discipline:
  * Anytime we change code, we need to run all the tests
  * Anytime we add new code, we need to add new tests to exercise the code, and make sure they pass
  * After adding new tests, run the full test suite to ensure no existing functionality is broken
- Make sure when changing code, specific tests pass first, before running the complete test suite
